Real Name: Tressa Crystal Smith
Age: 30
Home World: Boreas
Title: Defensive Conjurer

Tressa Crystal Smith isn’t everyone’s cup of tea–an elegant, standoffish woman, she likes crystals more than she 
likes most people. She grew up on Boreas, a faltering planet with a deteriorating moon. Conformity and efficiency 
were necessities there, but that never suited Tressa. Instead, she was more at home with fellow misfits who spent 
their time on crystal readings, moon rituals and personal witchery–they supported her through her self-discovery 
and transition, making her turbulent teenage years easier and less lonely. But when her closest friend went to 
extreme lengths to save their moon from corporate encroachment, Tressa was caught in the middle. Ultimately, she 
ran away from home, finding solace in the one place her friend cared about most: their moon, Cleo.

There she joined the terraforming crews hired to repair and rejuvenate the celestial body. She learned to work 
with ferrofluid, and use it with a certain witchy flair. She grew attached to her new community and, when the 
heat on Boreas died down, brought some of her old friends back into the fold. She found a place to call her 
own–just in time for the Apex Games to arrive and sweep it out from under her new family. But Catalyst won’t 
disappear so easily. If the Games are going to get in her way, she’s going to turn them to her advantage, 
putting the prize money to use supporting her family. She sees a win in her future, and she’ll rise to the occasion.
