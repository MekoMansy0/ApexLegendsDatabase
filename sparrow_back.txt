Real Name: Enea Davide Guarino
Age: 20
Home World: Psamathe
Title: Agile Archer

Enea was born into the most widely respected bounty hunter clan in all the Outlands, the Clessidra Rossa. These hunters 
serve as the most efficient law enforcement contractors, known for their unparalleled archery skills and their dogmatic moral 
code. They train their youth in the ways of the order, making even the teens more dangerous than many lawless assassins.

From an early age, Enea showed an innate aptitude for the trade far surpassing that of his peers. His skills and confidence 
are seen as a blessing and a curse to the group, because every trait that would make him a great potential leader is also 
seen as a liability by the old guard. Enea had been the clear successor of the head of the order, but he refused to see the 
world in such binary terms, and as he grew older his family felt increasingly concerned over his resistance to their views. 
Being raised by such a tightly-wound group made him restless, often leading him to make reckless decisions.

One particularly reckless action of Enea’s created a rift his family could not see a way back from, and it became clear that 
Enea and his family would never see eye to eye on Clessidra Rossa’s black-and-white approach to life. Unable to convince his 
family that some situations don’t have an obvious right and wrong, Enea was shunned from his family and the Clessidra Rossa.

Enea is heartbroken about leaving his family, but is determined to figure out how to have it all—both a life on his own terms 
and his family’s acceptance. While bounty hunting on his own to support himself, an unexpected bystander recruited him for the 
Apex Games—The perfect playground to flex his skills and have fun at the same time. In his heart, Enea is hopeful that the 
publicity of his successes will be a path to gaining back the respect of his family.
