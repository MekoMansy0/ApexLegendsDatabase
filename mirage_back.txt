Title: Holographic Trickster

Mirage is the kind of guy who likes to stand out. The youngest of four brothers, he perfected the art of fooling around 
to get attention. The one thing he took seriously was Holo-Pilot technology: introduced to the illusion-creating tech 
by his engineer mother, he poured over the mechanisms and learned all he could about them. Even when his brothers 
went MIA during the Outlands’ Civil War, Mirage and his mother continued to develop holo devices, and the work 
brought them closer.

While working as a bartender to make ends meet, Mirage heard amazing stories from his patrons about the Apex 
Games and the wealth and glory that came with victory. As good as both of those sounded, he knew he couldn’t 
risk leaving his mother childless – until she gave him a set of customized holo devices and told him to follow 
his dream. Mirage is now the life of the Apex Games, outwitting opponents and charming audiences across the 
Outlands, in front of cameras for the world - and his mother - to see.
