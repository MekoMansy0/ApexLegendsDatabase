Real Name: Dr. Mary Somers
Age: 39 (Give or take an extra 87 years…)
Home World: Solace
Title: Gravitational Manipulator

Almost a century ago, the Outlands were dangling on the edge of a cataclysmic energy crisis. Dr. Mary Somers, a 
charmingly eccentric astrophysicist, was hired to find a solution. Mary moved her family to the scientific research 
station on Olympus and set to work.

With the help of her apprentice, Dr. Reid, Mary discovered Branthium - an element she was convinced could be the 
key to limitless energy. But Branthium can be found only on the accretion disk of a black hole, so Mary and Dr. Reid 
departed on a dangerous mission to prove her theory right.

Mary promised her son Newton she’d return safe and sound. But Dr. Reid betrayed her, stealing the Branthium and 
sending her shuttle into the black hole’s orbit. Using her wits, Mary modified her robotic vacuum companion N.E.W.T. 
to escape. But time moves differently on the outskirts of a black hole, and she was 87 years too late.

Now Mary is determined to fund her research to find a way to go back in time and be with her son. She joins the 
Apex Games as Horizon, master of gravity, just in time for the next season to debut on Olympus--where her old life 
once was and where she had promised to return.
