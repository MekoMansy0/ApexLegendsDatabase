Real Name: Natalie Paquette
Age: 24
Home World: Solace
Title: Static Defender

Natalie “Wattson” Paquette is a familiar face in the Apex Games, though for a different reason than most. Daughter 
of the Games’ lead electrical engineer, she studied his manuals to stay close to him, and discovered her calling at 
a young age. Though she could be completely distracted one moment and hyper-focused the next, electricity 
grounded her – its ordered, predictable flow made sense in a way the rest of the world didn’t.

She devoured every book she could on the subject, and eventually became such a skilled engineer that she was 
commissioned to build the Apex Games’ Modified Containment Ring. Unfortunately, her father died the day it was 
revealed, leaving her alone. At her lowest moment, a group of competitors invited her to return to the arena 
with them, assuring her she would always have a home. She now fights alongside her friends in the arena she helped 
build, destroying incoming missiles, recharging shields, creating fences, and using her pylon to silence fights 
that get too loud. Nobody knows the arena better than Wattson – anyone who underestimates her is in for a shock.
