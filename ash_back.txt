Real Name: Dr. Ashleigh Reid
Age: 122
Home World: Unknown
Title: Incisive Instigator

Born in the unforgiving Frontier, Dr. Ashleigh Reid - still very much a human - learned early that the only person who 
was going to look out for her was herself. One day, she was hired by a mercenary group for a delicate job: steal an 
experimental fuel source being researched in the Outlands city of Olympus. It was the perfect job for Reid, who 
infiltrated and psychologically manipulated the researchers for years. When the lab self-destructed, she died.

And didn’t.

Her brain was put in a simulacrum shell, but in the process, she lost years of memories, and the trauma of her “death” 
caused her personality to fracture. Ash is the embodiment of the cold, perfectionistic, power-hungry side of Dr. Reid. 
But behind that confident facade, something sinister is simmering. After an encounter with Horizon that overrides Ash’s 
simulacrum programming, the framework that kept the vulnerable--yet intelligent--Leigh personality dormant has begun to 
crack. Ash joins the Games to prove she has transcended all humanity. Leigh’s determined to prove her wrong.
