Real Name: Octavio Silva
Age: 26
Home World: Psamathe
Title: High-Speed Daredevil

One day, Octavio Silva was bored. In fact, he was bored most days. Son of the preoccupied CEO of Silva 
Pharmaceuticals and wanting for nothing in life, he entertained himself by performing death-defying stunts and 
posting holovids of them for his fans to gawk over. He decided to set the course record for a nearby Gauntlet 
by launching himself across the finish line – using a grenade.

As he lay in triage hours later, the doctors informed him that the damage done to his legs meant his daredevil days 
were over. That didn’t sit well with Octavio, who turned to an old friend for help: Ajay Che, who he guilted into forging 
an order to replace his legs with bionic ones. Suddenly able to repair his limbs at a moment’s notice, Octavio decided 
petty online stunts weren’t enough: the ultimate adrenaline rush, the Apex Games, was calling. Since then, despite 
learning the man he thought was his father is his grandfather and new head of the Syndicate and the Games, he’s 
worked to become an Apex Champion by doing the most incredible, death-defying moves anyone’s ever seen. Maybe in 
the arena, he won’t be so bored.
