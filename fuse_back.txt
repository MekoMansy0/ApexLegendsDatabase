Title: Bombastic Explosives Expert

Ladies’ man, man’s man, and all-round manly man, Fuse is a one man wrecking crew... and he knows it. Fuse 
exudes joy; he’s a laid-back explosives enthusiast who’s damn near covered in things that go BOOM. Fuse 
doesn’t lack confidence, but he often lacks a plan. He’s a blow-up-first ask-questions-later kinda guy, who’s always 
looking for a good scrap.

Fuse grew up on Salvo--a brutal planet ruled by a rotating collection of misfit warlords bent on mayhem, murder, 
and good times. For most of his life, he worked as a mercenary alongside his childhood friend, Maggie. But while 
she aspired to become one of Salvo’s most powerful warlords, Fuse felt the pull of the arena. Fuse found his 
calling late in life fighting in Salvo’s bloodsport: the Bonecage. He proved to be the best, most charismatic and 
beloved gladiator on the planet. But he itched to join the grandest stage of them all: the Apex Games. While Salvo 
remained a part of Independent Space that dream was impossible, but once they joined the Syndicate, his chance arrived.
