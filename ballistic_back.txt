Real Name: August Montgomery Brinkman
Age: 63
Home World: Gaea
Title: Refined Gunslinger

August was the sole heir to the Brinkman fortune, built on shady backroom deals. But when those deals caught up 
with his parents, August was left a billionaire orphan. Wealthy, furious and self-destructive, August joined the 
Thunderdome Games (the pre-Apex Apex Games). Here, he took the name Ballistic and became a sensation! 
His style was wild, reckless, and utterly selfish⁠, helping him become the very first Thunderdome celebrity.

He was famed for his iconic CAR (“Lady Grey”, for the tea). It was here, in combat, that August would meet the 
love of his life, Sok Leng. They would quickly marry and have a son, Nathaniel. Sok Leng and her brother Kit Siang 
were an inseparable duo of destruction, and with August now in their squad, they seemed unstoppable.

But nothing lasts forever. August’s crowd-pandering combat style meant he wasn’t paying attention to his team when 
they needed him, leading to Kit Siang’s death. Devastated by guilt, August retreated into himself, driving away his 
wife and son. For nearly two decades, August lived as a recluse, keeping busy with small tasks to distract a lonely 
mind. And so August was largely forgotten, though not by everyone. His son, Nathaniel, was both enamored with his 
father’s victories and determined to surpass them. When his son qualified to join the dangerous Apex Games, August 
went to the Syndicate with an offer: take me instead.

His son would be safe from the path that ruined him. What better way to use those skills than in selfless service? 
And if it just so happens to be his favorite activity, killing all who stand against him… That’s quite the fortunate coincidence.
