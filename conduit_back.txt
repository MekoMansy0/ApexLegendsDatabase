Real Name: Rowenna Valentina Coffey Divina
Age: 27
Home World: Nexus
Title: Shield Healer

On her rebuilt homeworld of Nexus, Rowenna Valentina Coffey Divina chose joy, her ever-present smile offering 
hope amidst the rubble of a government coup. There, the remnants of a fallen Monarch Titan became a symbol of 
sacrifice, inspiring heroic tales of Legends that Rowenna spun for her siblings. Her sense of humor would be 
her family’s shield against the harshness of reality, and a secret weapon in Rowenna’s own quest to be an 
Apex Legend.

But when tragedy struck her oldest sister Diwa, Rowenna took her family’s fate into her own hands. She snuck 
into the restricted battlefields, salvaging the Titan's radioactive battery. From it, Rowenna forged a combat rig, 
harnessing its lethal energy to fight in local tournaments. Every victory helped support her loved ones and brought 
her closer to becoming a Legend, but at a grave cost: The battery’s fallout was slowly killing her.

It didn’t matter. To achieve her dream, it was a price Rowenna was ready to pay. Her success led neutral Nexus to 
its first invitation to the Apex Games, forcing a heated confrontation with Diwa, who recognized the armor’s fatal 
origin. But Rowenna had made her choice.

Now, as Conduit, she steps onto the battlefield. Equal parts fan and gladiator, fueled by the Monarch Titan's 
battery and her own quest to give her family a better life.

For Rowenna, an early death is inevitable, but right now–it’s Conduit’s chance for a day in the sun.
