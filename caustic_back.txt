Title: Toxic Trapper

Alexander Nox used to be one of the brightest scientists in the employ of Humbert Labs, the Frontierâ€™s leading 
manufacturer of pesticide gases. Nox worked day and night developing new formulas for the glut of pesticides 
needed to protect the crops that sustained the Outlands. But he soon realized that progress was being hampered by 
his testing methods. He needed to test on more than just inert tissue: he needed living subjects.

As he toiled in secret, Nox began to see the beauty in his creations and their ability to destroy anything they 
touched. But the head of Humbert Labs soon discovered his gruesome experiments, and their confrontation ended with 
the lab in flames. Now, competing under the name Caustic, he puts his gaseous creations to work in the Apex Games 
and observes their effects with great interest.
