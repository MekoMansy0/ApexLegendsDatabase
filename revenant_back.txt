Title: Synthetic Nightmare

Revenant used to be human. He used to be the greatest hitman the Mercenary Syndicate ever had. He used to look 
in the mirror and see his human face looking back. But time changes everything, and when his programming finally 
failed, he saw what he had become at the hands of the Mercenary Syndicate and Hammond Robotics: a walking 
nightmare of steel and vestigial flesh. His masters resurrected him as a simulacrum, snatching him from death’s 
embrace again and again and programming him to forget.

He hunted down every last person who did this to him, but the last thing he wanted, he couldn't have: the sweet 
release of death. Unable to die without destroying his preserved human head, he was on the hunt to find and deal 
with it. When Loba, a thief whose parents he'd murdered, came for her revenge, he nearly got what he wanted—but 
she kept him alive so he would continue to suffer. Then his world unraveled again when he woke up with his abilities 
torn from him and replaced with new ones. Now who's messing with him–and why? Revenant won’t stop until he finds out.
