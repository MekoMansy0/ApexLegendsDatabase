Real Name: Kairi Imahara
Age: 31
Home World: Angelia
Title: Winged Avenger

Bold, brash, fiery and fierce, Kairi Imahara isn’t above greasing palms and bending the law. When she was a child, 
she stole a Titan. It belonged to her dad: callsign Viper. She wanted to be just like him when she grew up. But the 
next day he left on a mission and never returned. In some ways, she still followed in his footsteps: it wasn't a 
Titan, but her ship offered a decent living. Her personal life, however, was anything but. During the day, she 
smuggled precious cargo, and at night, went shot for shot with the outlaws and mercs in the bars. But even though 
she had her ladies, her liquor, and her love of the sky, she was still obsessed with finding the man who’d put her 
father in harm’s way: his commander, Kuben Blisk.

She tracked Blisk down, prepared to kill him. But he spoke of her father with respect -- and challenged her to be 
better. She shot him anyway. But not to kill. Knowing she could get to him was enough. Well, that, and the Apex 
Games card she took from Blisk’s grasp.

Using the intact flight core from Viper’s Northstar, she built a sleek new jetpack that honored her father’s memory. 
And that was when Kairi could finally soar on her own… and in a version of her dad’s Titan, that ended up being hers after all.
