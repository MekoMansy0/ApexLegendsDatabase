Real Name: Margaret Kōhere
Age: 56
Home World: Salvo
Title: Rebel Warlord

Margaret Kōhere - the woman who would one day be known as Mad Maggie - grew up in one of the dustiest, dullest 
corners of Salvo without any family to speak of. She was fortunate, then, to meet a kindred chaotic spirit: an 
adventurous young boy named Walter Fitzroy. The two were inseparable, and in their teenage years, they became 
mercenaries. Eventually this duo grew into the Cracked Talon - a powerful mercenary operation. It was here she 
earned her nom de guerre: Mad Maggie. But when rival warlord Sandringham Kelly signed a treaty with the 
Syndicate, Maggie’s hopes for an independent Salvo were ruined, and Fuse abandoned her for the Games, leaving 
Maggie very mad indeed…

By sabotaging Fuse’s entrance into the Apex games, Maggie planned to expose how weak the Syndicate was, in 
hopes it would spark rebellion on Salvo.

Fuse would assemble a team to take down Maggie… only for the pair to have a heart to heart where they came 
to accept each other’s choices: Fuse will always follow the fun, and Maggie will always follow the cause.

It seemed as though Maggie fell to her death after that exchange...But she was apprehended by the Syndicate, 
and sentenced to fight to the death in the Apex Games. So she will: just not hers.
