Real Name: Ramya Parekh
Age: 23
Home World: Gaea
Title: Amped Modder

Rampart is a blue-collar, private business owner who just needs a big gun and a backpack full of scrap metal to get 
by in the dangerous, wild west world of the Outlands. Before opening her popular modding shop on Gaea, Ramya 
Parekh (Rampart for short) made a name for herself in the underground gauntlet circuit. Parekh climbed to the 
top showcasing pure skill using her custom-modded gear. She began taking jobs from smugglers, Syndicate 
members, and everyone in between. Some say it ain’t great unless it’s got “Rampart” written on it.

Parekh never shied away from letting people know how great she was, or better yet, how bad they were. Maybe 
that’s what led a group of assailants to ambush her at her shop one night. Her business burned down and she was 
left with nothing -- except an Apex Card. For Parekh, the Apex card is more than just an invitation to 
compete - it's a sign that she may have lost her shop, but she didn't lose what built it. Like her motto says, 
she's the kind of person who can always "turn crap into gold.”
