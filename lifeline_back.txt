Real Name: Ajay Che
Age: 26
Home World: Psamathe
Title: Combat Medic

Ajay Che, aka Lifeline, isn’t someone you would expect to find in the Apex Games. The child of wealthy war profiteers, 
she left home when she learned of the damage her family had caused and enlisted in the Frontier Corps, a 
humanitarian organization that aids Frontier communities in need. She’s since devoted her life to helping 
others and joined the Apex Games to give more funds to those in need.

Since no one in the Games is innocent — they all know what they signed up for — and every one of her victories 
means help for those in need, Lifeline has no problem engaging in the popular bloodsport. Or so she tells 
herself. She may seem sarcastic and callous, but deep down she wants to help people and make the world a better 
place. If that means taking a few people down in the process, so be it.
