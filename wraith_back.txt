Real Name: Renee Hope Blasey
Age: 34
Home World: Typhon
Title: Interdimensional Skirmisher

Wraith is a whirlwind fighter, able to execute deadly attacks and manipulate spacetime by opening rifts in the fabric 
of reality — but those abilities came at a price. Years ago, she woke up in an IMC detention facility with no memory 
of who she was. Senior Science Pilot Renee Blasey, who volunteered as guinea pig for her own experiments... whose 
partner betrayed her and locked her away… no longer existed. All that was left was a timid girl, frightened by a 
cacophony of voices in her head, until another version of herself appeared and taught her to listen to the voices. 
Following her lead, Wraith found the strength to break free from her prison and escape into a different 
reality - this reality.

Finally free, but still robbed of her memories, Wraith continues her quest to learn more about who she was before the 
experiments. With so many of the Apex Games held on old IMC bases, Wraith now competes so she can access the 
mysterious facilities and continue to learn more about who she was. She remains a fixture of the Apex Games, and with 
every match she gets closer to the truth, even if she sometimes feels scared to find out more about who she used to be.
