Real Name: Blódhundr
Age: 40
Home World: Talos
Title: Technological Tracker

Bloodhound is known across the Outlands as one of the greatest game hunters the Frontier has ever seen. The child 
of two engineers stationed at the New Dawn industrial plant on Talos, Bloodhound was taken in by their uncle Artur 
after a meltdown destroyed the facility and killed both their parents. Artur taught them the Old Ways, a belief 
system that focuses on the glory of nature and rejects modern technology. Yet Bloodhound was constantly drawn to 
technological marvels, and ultimately used both new and old methods to take down a Goliath that preyed on the 
people of their village, forever changing their life’s path.

After Bloodhound’s lover was unceremoniously killed in the Thunderdome, they vowed to win enough battles that 
they could both enter Valhalla… and the Apex Games were the perfect place for Bloodhound to accumulate victories. 
Their unparalleled tracking skills are a boon to any team they join, helping them root out hidden opponents and 
track enemy movements. Calling on Earth’s Old Norse Gods to guide them, Bloodhound believes that destiny is a 
path that has already been laid out, eventually carrying all to their death. But with that knowledge comes 
strength, because until that day comes, Bloodhound knows they can’t be stopped.
