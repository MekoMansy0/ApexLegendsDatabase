Pathfinder is the picture of optimism, despite his circumstances. A MRVN (Mobile Robotic Versatile eNtity) with a 
talent for location scouting and surveying, he booted up decades ago in an abandoned warehouse with no idea who 
created him or why. With only his MRVN designation to hint at his identity, Pathfinder eventually set off in search 
of his creator. Thanks to the help of the Legends, he learned he was built by the Outlands’ greatest scientists to 
help solve the Outlands’ energy crisis.

Pathfinder has learned much in his travels since then (like how to make a mean Eastern Leviathan Stew) but his most 
important discovery is that some of his spare parts were used to build another machine… Pathfinder’s child. He 
originally joined the Apex Games to gain a following and hopefully draw the attention of his maker, but now he aims 
to draw the attention of anyone who might know about his child. In the meantime, he remains enthusiastic and helpful, 
always ready to make new friends (then shoot them).
